# Projects Feedback with Groups Supervised by YingXing Cheng

This project involves providing feedback for several projects supervised by YingXing Cheng in the [``Mathematical Programming for Teaching``](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/ilias.php?baseClass=ilrepositorygui&ref_id=3636004) course.

:warning: **VERY IMPORTANT**:

- A 15-minute discussion is **mandatory** and should be held every week for each group to ask questions and present the current state.
- **Two** meetings in total are mandatory for each phase.
- **Please check this page frequently for the latest information on times.**

:warning: **How do we organize the meeting?**

- I'm available to discuss in person or online. My available office times can be found below for each phase. Please let me know if you prefer to use `Webex` for online meeting and provide the room link in advance.

:warning: **What if you have questions when I am unavailable?**

- You can write an email if you have any questions related to the projects.
- [*Optional but highly recommended*] You are all free to open an issue on this GitHub repository to ask any questions related to the project when you need help. Please mention the group ID and format your question clearly. More details about [how to open an issue on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

### Some Project Hints

#### Schaltkreis-Analyse

- To run `demo.py`, `schemdraw` should be installed first.
  The easiest way is to run the following command

  ```bash
  pip install schemdraw
  ```

  See [this guide](https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/start.html) for more details.

- You also need to copy the `schemutils.py` file into the same directory or comment out the line `from schemutils import convert_to_graph, add_solution`, which is not used in the latest `demo.py` file.

- If you run the IDE and no figure is displayed after running the script, you can try the following ways to fix this issue:

  - Run the script in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python demo.py
    ```

  - Save the figure instead of displaying it directly in your IDE by modifying `demo.py` and using `d.save()`:

    ```python
    # ... it is the same as the original one
    d = demo_drawing()
    # d.draw()
    d.save("demo.svg")
    ```

    Then you should get a file named `demo.svg` as follows:
    ![demo.svg](./phase2/demo.svg)

    I also attached this modified `demo.py` file in this repo. See [demo.py](./phase2/demo.py).

#### Gradientenverfahren

- The $j$ in $\{\tau^j : j \in \mathbb{N}\}$ represents the exponential power of $\tau$.
